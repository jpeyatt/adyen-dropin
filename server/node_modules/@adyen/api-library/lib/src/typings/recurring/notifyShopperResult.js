/**
 * Adyen Recurring API
 * The Recurring APIs allow you to manage and remove your tokens or saved payment details. Tokens should be created with validation during a payment request.  For more information, refer to our [Tokenization documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/tokenization). ## Authentication To connect to the Recurring API, you must use your basic authentication credentials. For this, create your web service user, as described in [How to get the WS user password](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials). Then use its credentials to authenticate your request, for example:  ``` curl -U \"ws@Company.YourCompany\":\"YourWsPassword\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ ... ``` Note that when going live, you need to generate new web service user credentials to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/live-endpoints).  ## Versioning Recurring API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.  For example: ``` https://pal-test.adyen.com/pal/servlet/Recurring/v49/disable ```
